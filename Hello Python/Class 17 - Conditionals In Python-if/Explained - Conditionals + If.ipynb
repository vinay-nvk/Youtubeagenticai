    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is met. They help in decision-making in a program, allowing for different actions based on different conditions. In Python, the main types of conditional statements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `if` statement\n",
    "2. `if-else` statement\n",
    "3. `if-elif-else` statement\n",
    "4. Nested `if` statements\n"

    "## The `if` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement in Python is used to decide whether a certain block of code should be executed or not. It is similar to the `if` statements found in languages like C or Java. If the condition specified in the `if` statement is `True`, then the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed.\n",

    "# Industry Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are widely used in various industries for different purposes. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web Development**: Conditional statements are used to display different content based on user input or roles. For example, displaying a different user interface for admins and regular users.\n",
    "2. **Data Analysis**: Conditional statements help in filtering data. For example, selecting rows from a dataset that meet certain criteria.\n",
    "3. **Automation**: Used in scripts to perform different actions based on the results of a previous command. For example, running a backup script only if there is enough disk space.\n",
    "4. **Game Development**: Conditional statements are crucial in game logic, such as determining if a player has won or lost a game.\n",
    "5. **Finance**: Used to make decisions based on financial data, such as approving or rejecting loan applications based on credit scores.\n"

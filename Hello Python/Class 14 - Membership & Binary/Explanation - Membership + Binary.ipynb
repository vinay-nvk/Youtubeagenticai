    "## Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. **What is the purpose of the `in` operator in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `in` operator is used to check if a value exists in a sequence (such as a string, list, tuple, or set). It returns `True` if the value is found, otherwise it returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **How does the `not in` operator work in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `not in` operator is used to check if a value does not exist in a sequence. It returns `True` if the value is not found, otherwise it returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. **Write a code snippet to check if the letter 'a' is in the string 'banana'.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "\n",
    "   string = 'banana'\n",
    "\n",
    "   print('a' in string)  # True\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. **What is the difference between `&` and `|` operators in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `&` operator (bitwise AND) compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1. The `|` operator (bitwise OR) compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. **Write a code snippet to demonstrate the use of the bitwise XOR operator.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "\n",
    "   a = 5  # binary: 0101\n",
    "\n",
    "   b = 3  # binary: 0011\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(a ^ b)  # result: 0110 (6 in decimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. **How does the bitwise NOT operator (`~`) function in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The bitwise NOT operator inverts all the bits in the binary representation of the number. In Python, the result is computed as `-(x + 1)`, effectively flipping all the bits and adding 1 to the original number's negative form.\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. **What is the result of the expression `5 << 2`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The result of `5 << 2` is 20. The binary representation of 5 is `0101`. Shifting left by 2 positions gives `10100`, which is 20 in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "8\\. **Write a code snippet to perform a bitwise right shift on the number 32 by 3 positions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "\n",
    "   a = 32  # binary: 100000\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(a >> 3)  # result: 000100 (4 in decimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9\\. **Explain a real-world scenario where bitwise operations are used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Bitwise operations are used in network programming for manipulating IP addresses and subnet masks. For example, applying a bitwise AND operation between an IP address and a subnet mask can determine the network portion of the address.\n",
    "\n",
    "10\\. **How can membership operators be used in data security?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Membership operators can be used to verify user permissions and roles. For example, checking if a user's role is present in a list of authorized roles before granting access to a resource.\n"
